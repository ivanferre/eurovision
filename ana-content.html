    <h2>Dana International: Diva (1998)</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q8ZfreUQfvc" title="DIVA - DANA INTERNATIONAL (Israel 1998 - Eurovision Song Contest HD)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Sharon Cohen, professionally known as Dana International, is an Israeli pop singer. Sharon's stage name Dana International comes from the title track of her album, and was originally spelled with two n's. At 18 years of age, Cohen (still legally male at the time) earned a living as a drag queen, parodying many famous female singers. Dana was chosen to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 1998 in Birmingham with the song "Diva", and her childhood dream of performing in the song contest finally came true.</p>
    <p>She was tall, svelte and glamorous in a floor-length glitter gown, with luscious brown curls and the kind of dramatic arm movements that would put an ice dancer to shame. Plus, she had an unmistakable pronunciation of the word Cleopatra. Dana International cut a dazzling figure in May 1998 when she won Eurovision for Israel. Her song, Diva, had a lot to do with it: an earworm with a thick club beat and a karaoke-ready chorus that you could make up as you went along if you didn't quite catch all the Hebrew. Dana was also Eurovision's first ever trans winner. Twenty years ago, there was no Ru Paul or Trixie Mattel; the Oscar-winning Hilary Swank movie Boys Don't Cry was a year away. The likes of TV series Transparent, or actors such as Laverne Cox, were off in the distance. The trans community wasn't invisible, but it wasn't the staple of the pop culture conversation that it has become; Dana's performance at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena felt like a watershed moment, a major celebration of a trans artist on an international stage.</p>
    <p>It wasn't without its trials, and Dana's representation of her country created a furore among Israel's Orthodox Jewish community. After her win, she addressed her detractors. “My victory proves God is on my side,” read her statement. “I want to send my critics a message of forgiveness: try to accept me. I am what I am.” Today, she claims she enjoyed the backlash. “I don't care what they say about me,” she says. “I believe in God, in freedom, that everyone has a right to live how they choose.”</p>

    <h2>Conchita Wurst: Rise Like A Phoenix (2014)</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SaolVEJEjV4" title="Conchita Wurst - Rise Like a Phoenix (Austria) 2014 LIVE Eurovision Second Semi-Final" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Conchita Wurst is an Austrian singer and drag queen. Born in Gmunden, Thomas Neuwirth moved to Graz to do his matura exam with a focus on fashion, before embarking on a singing career through the 2007 casting show Starmania. He subsequently became a founding member of the short-lived boy band Jetzt Anders!. In 2011, Neuwirth began appearing as Conchita—a female character noted for her beard—and came second in the Austrian pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012.</p>
    <p>The Austrian entry Conchita Wurst began her performance of her diva anthem Rise Like a Phoenix. As she continued, the lights slowly revealed more of her sparkling, form-hugging dress, before spreading to illuminate her hirsute jaw. Hers was a meticulous drag act, with a twist — Conchita Wurst sports a full beard. Eurovision, often associated with camp and queer culture, has long been a forum for these kinds of resistant performances. Camp, though, has rarely been performed with such earnestness. And even rarer still, she won.</p>
    <p>Conchita Wurst's victory at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2014 had a significant impact both within the contest and in the broader social and cultural context. Here are some of the key impacts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Promoting LGBTQ+ Visibility: Conchita Wurst, the stage persona of Austrian singer Thomas Neuwirth, identifies as a drag queen and a gay man. The victory of Conchita Wurst helped to promote LGBTQ+ visibility on a global stage, challenging stereotypes and prejudices. It sparked conversations about gender identity, acceptance, and tolerance, particularly in parts of Eastern Europe where LGBTQ+ rights were less advanced.</li>
        <li>Symbol of Diversity and Inclusion: Conchita Wurst's win was seen as a victory for diversity and inclusion. The song "Rise Like a Phoenix" represented resilience and empowerment. It resonated with many people who felt marginalized or struggled with their identity. The image of Conchita Wurst, with a full beard and feminine attire, challenged traditional notions of gender and beauty, emphasizing that everyone should be accepted for who they are.</li>
        <li>Political and Social Impact: Conchita Wurst's victory sparked discussions about LGBTQ+ rights and acceptance, particularly in countries with more conservative views. It led to debates on equality, discrimination, and human rights. The contest became a platform for addressing these issues and pushing for progress.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Overall, Conchita Wurst's Eurovision victory had a profound impact on promoting LGBTQ+ visibility, fostering discussions on acceptance, and inspiring individuals to embrace diversity and authenticity. It remains an important moment in the history of the Eurovision Song Contest and the broader cultural landscape.</p>

    <h2>Lys Assia: Refrain (1956)</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/muaEpHexmwg" title="Refrain - Lys Assia (Eurovision Song Contest - Switzerland 1956)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Lys Assia (born Rosa Mina Schärer) was a Swiss singer who won the first Eurovision Song Contest in 1956. Assia was born in Rupperswil, Aargau, and began her stage career as a dancer, but changed to singing in 1940 after successfully standing in for a female singer.</p>
    <p>Being the first ever Eurovision winner, Lys Assia may have been entitled to the title of First Lady of the contest, yet she never took it for granted. In fact, she acted as proud ambassador for the contest, the success of which no one could imagine back in the days she took part and won. Especially in the last fifteen years Lys Assia proudly carried out the duties of her role as ambassador — a role with unspoken and unwritten duties, most of which she defined herself.</p>
    <p>Lys Assia remained a loyal supporter of the Eurovision Song Contest, being a guest of honour in many occasions, like in Gothenburg in 1985 when Eurovision was celebrating its 30th edition. In 2003, she addressed millions of viewers via a satellite link from Cyprus, wishing the contestants the best of luck ahead of the Grand Final in Riga. Being asked by presenter Marie N., who also won the contest the year before, how she looked back at the 1956 contest, she spoke the legendary words: "It was fun — I won!" In 2005, she performed during Congratulations, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest and in 2008 she started the voting in Belgrade.</p>

    <h2>Hatari: Hatrið mun sigra (2019)</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kTb69WkBbvs" title="Iceland - LIVE - Hatari - Hatrið mun sigra - Grand Final - Eurovision 2019" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Hatari is an Icelandic techno, industrial and punk rock band and performance art group from Reykjavík. Their public image incorporates elements of anti-capitalism and BDSM attire. On stage, the group, whose name means “Hater”, presents a fascist-inspired dystopia of blood-splattered whippings. In person, they are softly spoken and occasionally cheerfully optimistic.</p>
    <p>“Hate will prevail... and Europe's heart impale. Burn off its web of lies. Now from the conflagration... rise in unity.” — what a song for Eurovision, isn't it? The world's longest-running televised song competition boasts a proud history of pop ballads light on meaning and heavy on fun and glitz, making it a wonder that a black leather, highly sexualized group who revel in pain have made it to Eurovision with a song entitled Hate Will Prevail. The pair of cousins, both 25, dreamed up the performance art group during a stroll in the nighttime sun in Reykjavík several years ago, contemplating the rise of populism in Europe. Hate Will Prevail takes it forward, imagining a dark future. The militaristic, authoritarian style of BDSM — bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism — seemed apt and they have been welcomed, they say, with open arms by the Icelandic fetish community.</p>
    <p>Hatari have emerged as the most controversial act this year, putting politics front of stage in a contest that has been at pains stay apolitical, to the point of adding censorship of lyrics and speeches into its rules. Eurovision, created in 1956 in the aftermath of the second world war, has always been deeply, if not overtly, political. Countries with close linguistic, ethnic or diplomatic ties often vote for each other. Israel has sought to use Eurovision for political gain, originally planning to host it in Jerusalem in a campaign for international recognition of the holy city as its capital. The organisers chose Tel Aviv instead. They have the additional bonus of the fact that everyone loves an outsider — especially at Eurovision.</p>
    <p>Hatari have managed to galvanise an army of weirdos, hipsters, homosexuals, grannies and, somewhat inexplicably, their biggest fanbase: Icelandic children. Hatari really put itself in the crossfire in the name of love. It sacrificed itself, just to show Israel and BDS that they can agree on something. They truly brought people together. And they would have deserved to win the award for that.</p>

    <h2>The “boring French song” phenomenon</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJful-Jtc9o" title="Lisa Angell - N&#39;oubliez Pas (France) - LIVE at Eurovision 2015 Grand Final" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>When you hear “France” and “Eurovision” side by side, what distinctive features come to your mind? How would you describe a typical French entry for Eurovision? Most likely roughly like this: an incredibly good-looking woman (less frequently — man) in a stunning gown, expressing A LOT of strong emotions, often in the form of a ballad while sounding very “french” if you know what I mean. All these epithets formed a kind of stereotype of a typical French performance at the Eurovision Song Contest, as the Youtube comments section confirms. A huge number of people write about how the French performances look and sound the same every year. And they are not entirely wrong here. Obviously, beauty is in eye of the beholder, but the “french pattern” is definitely a thing.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, the last song in French that won Eurovision was performed by Celine Dion of Switzerland in 1988. Even though France had won first place five times before 1988, the song by Celine Dion was the last winning song in French in the last 35 years. One can assume that, in a sense, this performance defined this stereotype of most French-speaking performances. One can assume that, in a sense, this performance defined this stereotype of most French-speaking performances. This format, as we can see, has not been the most successful in the last 35 years.</p>
    <p>To illustrate that, let's have a look at Lisa Angell's "N'oubliez Pas". Safe to say that this performance checks nearly all the contingent criteria of a typical “boring French song“: a woman in an elegant black dress singing in a tearful voice about the need to remember World War I and, more broadly, wars in general. This is certainly a very strong message, but probably not the best format for a contest like this. Thus, the singer took 25th place out of 27.</p>

    <h2>Verka Serduchka: Dancing Lasha Tumbai (2007)</h2>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hfjHJneVonE" title="Verka Serduchka - Dancing Lasha Tumbai | Ukraine 🇺🇦 | Grand Final - Eurovision 2007" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Verka Seduchka is the drag persona of Ukrainian comedian and pop singer Andriy Danylko. He began his career in 1991 and invented the character's name by combining the randomly picked first name Verka and the last name of a former school classmate, Anya Serduk. Although he has also performed under his real name, most of his performances are done under this stage name.</p>
    <p>When Ukraine chose Verka Serduchka for the Eurovision Song Contest in 2007 fans had mixed feelings about this act. Today, many have learned to love the iconic act. Moreover, even outside of the Eurovision fan community, people easily associate Verka Serduchka with the song contest and its sometimes over the top gimmicks. Dressed as a silver disco ball, this act stood out. Two dancers in silver uniforms stood next to him wearing the number 18 in their uniforms while Verka had a suggestive number 69 on his back. An accordion player and two backing singers in golden uniforms also supported Verka. During the performance, Verka moved around the stage dancing and interacting with the dancers and supporting musicians in a suggestive/comic manner. Dancing Lasha Tumbai contained lyrics in English, German, Russian and Ukranian. The lyrics of the song caused some controversy because some found the words “lasha tumbai” sounded similar to “Russia goodbye”. Verka of course denied that the lyrics have any political connotation.</p>
    <p>At the end of the final Dancing Lasha Tumbai received 235 points. It ended in second place giving Ukraine one of its best results in the contest. Nevertheless, reactions to Verka's participation were mixed at the time. For instance, Verka Serduchka won the Barbara Dex Award for “worst outfit” at the Eurovision Song Contest. Nevertheless, one of the main reasons for Verka Serduchka's popularity and love from the Eurovision community is the infectious and upbeat nature of the performance. The song "Dancing Lasha Tumbai" had a catchy melody and a memorable chorus that resonated with viewers. Verka Serduchka's energetic dance moves and comedic facial expressions added to the overall entertaining spectacle. Furthermore, the performance stood out due to its bold and unconventional approach. Verka Serduchka challenged gender norms and stereotypes by presenting herself as a flamboyant character with exaggerated makeup, costumes, and gestures. This unique portrayal was widely celebrated as it brought an element of inclusivity and celebration of diversity to the stage. Verka Serduchka's act also showcased a sense of humor that resonated with many viewers. The comedic elements, including witty lyrics and playful interactions with the backup dancers, brought a lighthearted and enjoyable experience to the audience. The performance was a perfect blend of music, humor, and spectacle, which contributed to its enduring popularity and iconic status within the Eurovision community.</p>
