The Musical Guilty Pleasure

## Notes on Structure

- Header presenting the topic.
- Menu at Top: Main, Credits, About
- Credits: the four authors, and their favourite Eur Songs
- About: What technologies we used, what articles we read,...
- Both Credits and About also with Scrollorama.
- Text content to the right, displaying basic concepts.
- To the left, videos of the most iconic/representative songs, maybe pictures of other participants, relevant for their looks or personality (but not their music).
- Videos play silent and when clicking on them, then music sound plays.
- Info on videos (Artist, Song, Year) goes in parallel with the video frame.
- At the bottom there may be links to top and relevant anchors.
- Also at the bottom, the credits: who made this, and how (just a brief note).
- Also at the bottom, further references section: all the links we wanted (were tempted to) include, but we realized it was too much information.

Question: what if the user wants to keep reading but listening to the past video?
