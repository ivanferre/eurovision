## What it is

The Eurovision Song Contest, is an international song competition organised annually by the European Broadcasting Union.

Each participating country submits an original song to be performed live, with competing countries then casting votes for the other countries' songs to determine a winner.

Eurovision has been held annually since 1956 (apart from 2020), making it the longest-running annual international televised music competition and one of the world's longest-running television programmes.

Active members of the EBU and invited associate members are eligible to compete; as of 2023, 52 countries have participated at least once.

Each participating broadcaster sends one original song of three minutes duration or less to be performed live by a singer or group of up to six people aged 16 or older.

Each country awards 1â€“8, 10 and 12 points to their ten favourite songs, based on the views of an assembled group of music professionals and the country's viewing public, with the song receiving the most points declared the winner.

Originally consisting of a single evening event, the contest has expanded as new countries joined (including countries outside of Europe, such as Australia), leading to the introduction of relegation procedures in the 1990s, before the creation of semi-finals in the 2000s.

As of 2023, Germany has competed more times than any other country, having participated in all but one edition.

Ireland and Sweden both hold the record for the most victories, with seven wins each in total.

Traditionally held in the country which won the preceding year's event, the contest provides an opportunity to promote the host country and city as a tourist destination.

The contest has aired in countries across all continents; it has been available online via the official Eurovision website since 2001.

Eurovision ranks among the world's most watched non-sporting events every year, with hundreds of millions of viewers globally.

Performing at the contest has often provided artists with a local career boost and in some cases long-lasting international success.

## History

The Eurovision Song Contest was developed as an experiment in live television broadcasting and a way to produce cheaper television programming for national broadcasting organisations.

The EBU's general assembly agreed to the organising of the song contest in October 1955, under the initial title of the European Grand Prix, and accepted a proposal by the Swiss delegation to host the event in Lugano in the spring of 1956.

Seven countries participated in the first contest, each one with two songs (only time that more than one song per country was permitted). Voting was held behind closed doors, with only the winner announced on stage. The song Refrain, interpreted by the Swiss singer Lys Assia, was claimed the victory.

 Changes in Europe following the end of the Cold War saw an influx of new countries from Central and Eastern Europe applying for the first time. From the nineties, contest expanded to more than one day event to accomodate a pre-qualifying round and later semi-finals to allow for more countries to participate.

Well-known participants include ABBA, Celine Dion, Katrina & The Waves, Olivia Newton-John, Las Ketchup...

Songs that became big hits include Waterloo, Volare,...
Also the Riverdance dance show that has extensively toured worldwide had its origin as a performance during the main interval act between the song performances and the voting act.

70 songs from 27 countries have won the Eurovision Song Contest as of 2023. Of the 52 countries to have taken part, 25 have yet to win.

Johnny Logan from Ireland was the first interpreter to win twice (1980 and 1987).

Ireland and Sweden lead the scoreboard with seven victories each country.

The United Kingdom holds the record for the highest number of second-place finishes, having finished runner-up sixteen times.

Norway has come last more than any other country, appearing at the bottom of the scoreboard on eleven occasions, including scoring nul points four times.

Non-contest performances include not only Riverdance but also Aqua, t.A.t.U., Madonna, Justin Timberlake or Cirque du Soleil.

## Political Issues

The contest has been the subject of considerable criticism regarding
both its musical content and what has been reported to be a political
element to the event, and several controversial moments have been
witnessed over the course of its history.

As artists and songs ultimately represent a country, the contest has seen several controversial moments where political tensions between competing countries as a result of frozen conflicts, and in some cases open warfare, are reflected in the performances and voting.

This has been the case with Cyprus, Turkey and Greece; Armenia and Azerbaijan; Russia and Ukraine; or Georgia withdrawing and Belarus being disqualified due to the name and lyrics of their submitted songs; or protests around Israel participation.

## Political and Geographical Voting

The contest has been described as containing political elements in its voting process, a perception that countries will give votes more frequently and in higher quantities to other countries based on political relationships, rather than the musical merits of the songs themselves. Numerous studies and academic papers have been written on this subject, which have corroborated that certain countries form "clusters" or "cliques" by frequently voting in the same way.

## LGBT

Eurovision has had a long-held fan base in the LGBT community, and contest organisers have actively worked to include these fans in the event since the 1990s. Paul Oscar became the contest's first openly gay artist to compete when he represented Iceland in 1997. Israel's Dana International, the contest's first trans performer, became the first LGBT artist to win in 1998. In 2021, Nikkie de Jager became the first trans person to host the contest.

Several open members of the LGBT community have since gone on to compete and win: Conchita Wurst won the 2014 contest for Austria; Krista Siegfrids' performance of "Marry Me" at the 2013 contest included a same-sex kiss with one of her female backing dancers; and the stage show of Ireland's Ryan O'Shaughnessy's "Together" in 2018 had two male dancers portraying a same-sex relationship. Drag performers, such as Ukraine's Verka Serduchka, Denmark's DQ and Slovenia's Sestre, have appeared, including Wurst winning in 2014.

In recent years, various political ideologies across Europe have clashed in the Eurovision setting, particularly on LGBT rights. This has reflected on some broadcasters pulling out of the contest such Turkey, Hungary, Russia, or China.

## Cultural Influence

The Eurovision Song Contest has amassed a global following and sees annual audience figures of between 100 and 600 million.[358][359] The contest has become a cultural influence worldwide since its first years, is regularly described as having kitsch appeal.

Eurovision has a large online following and multiple independent websites, news blogs and fan clubs are dedicated to the event. One of the oldest and largest Eurovision fan clubs is OGAE, founded in 1984 in Finland and currently a network of over 40 national branches across the world.

In the run-up to each year's contest, several countries regularly host smaller events between the conclusion of the national selection shows in March and the contest proper in May, known as the "pre-parties". These events typically feature the artists which will go on to compete at that year's contest, and consist of performances at a venue and meet-and-greets with fans and the press.
