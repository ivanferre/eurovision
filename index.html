            <p>
                The Eurovision Song Contest is an <b>international song competition</b> organized annually by the European Broadcasting Union. Each participating country submits an original song to be performed live and transmitted to national broadcasters via the Eurovision and Euroradio networks, with competing countries then casting votes for the other countries' songs to determine a winner.</p>
            <p>
                Traditionally held in the country which won the preceding year's event, the contest provides an opportunity to <b>promote the host country and city</b> as a tourist destination. Thousands of spectators attend each year, along with journalists who cover all aspects of the contest, including rehearsals in venues, press conferences with the competing acts, in addition to other related events and performances in the host city.

            <h2>ABBA: Waterloo (1974)</h2>
            <p>ABBA are a Swedish super-group formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha F√§ltskog, Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. The group's name is an acronym of the first letters of their first names arranged as a palindrome. They are <b>one of the most popular and successful musical groups of all time</b>, and are one of the best-selling music acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982, and in 2022.
            </p>
            <p>In 1974, ABBA were Sweden's first winner of the Eurovision Song Contest with the song "Waterloo", which was <b>specifically</b> to be entered into the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. The original title of the song was "Honey Pie". The song's lyrics are metaphorical and are about a woman who "surrenders" to a man and promises to love him, likening it to Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.
            </p>
            <p>The song differed from the standard "dramatic ballad" tradition of the Eurovision Song Contest by its <b>and rhythm</b>, as well as by its performance. ABBA gave the audience something that had rarely been seen before in Eurovision: <b>flashy costumes</b> (including silver platform boots), plus a catchy uptempo song and even simple choreography. In 2005, ‚ÄúWaterloo‚Äù was chosen as the <b>best song in the competition's history</b> as part of the 50th anniversary celebration of the contest.</p>

            <h2 id="hardrockhallelujah">Lordi: Hard Rock Hallelujah (2006)</h2>
            <p>Lordi is a Finnish rock band, formed in 1992 by the band's lead singer, songwriter, and costume maker, Mr. Lordi (Tomi Petteri Putaansuu). Influenced by hard rock and heavy metal music, Lordi are known for wearing <b>monster masks</b> and using horror elements with pyrotechnics during concerts and music videos.</p>
            <p>The song was the surprise winner of the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest. Lordi is a Finnish monster rock band, and their entry attracted controversy and was regarded as something of a joke. <b>Finland had never won Eurovision</b> since its inception in 1956, and because of the country's appalling record it was decided that it had nothing to lose. But Lordi had the last laugh, and romped home with a record 292 points.</p>

            <p>Alexander Igorevich Rybak is a Belarusian-Norwegian singer-composer, violinist, pianist and actor. Representing Norway in the 2009 contest, he won the competition with 387 points ‚Äîthe <b>highest tally any country has achieved in the history of Eurovision</b> under the then-voting system‚Äî with ‚ÄúFairytale‚Äù. Winning at the age of 23, Rybak remains the <b></b>youngest solo male winner of the contest</b> and the only Belarusian-born winner to date.
            </p>
            <p>Fairytale" was inspired by <b>Norwegian folk music</b>. The song was composed and written by Rybak and was performed with the modern folk dance company Frikar.
            </p>
            <p>His win was celebrated throughout Europe for <b>crushing stereotypes</b> about the contest, such as needing an over-the-top performance or the influence of neighbor voting.

            <p>Loreen (born Lorine Zineb Nora Talhaoui) is a Swedish singer. She won the Eurovision Song Contest for Sweden in 2012 in Baku with the song Euphoria and again in Liverpool in 2023 with the song Tattoo. This makes her the <b>second person after Johnny Logan</b> to win the Eurovision Song Contest twice.
            </p>
            <p>In the run-up to the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, Loreen caused a stir by publicly <b>commenting on the human rights situation</b> in the host country, Azerbaijan, and by meeting with the country's opposition figures. Together with Anke Engelke's message to the Azerbaijani opposition via video message during the awarding of points, Loreen was one of the few central figures who publicly declared their political convictions.
            </p>
            <p>‚ÄúEuphoria‚Äù won the competition with a total of 372 points, at the time the second-highest point total in the contest's history.

            </p>

            <p>M√•neskin is an Italian rock band. The band is composed of vocalist Damiano David, bassist Victoria De Angelis, guitarist Thomas Raggi, and drummer Ethan Torchio. <b>Performing in the streets</b> in its early days, it rose to prominence after finishing second in the eleventh season of the Italian version of X Factor in 2017. Its international breakthrough occurred when the foursome won the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 for Italy with the song "Zitti e buoni".
            </p>
            <p>"Zitti e buoni" (‚ÄúQuiet and Well-Behaved‚Äù) was written and produced by all of M√•neskin's members. The song's <b>initial ballad version</b> was written in 2016, but was gradually reworked into a rock song through the years. M√•neskin spoke of the title as "referring to a cathartic anger, our anger transformed into something positive, which leads to change things".
            </p>
            <p>M√•neskin received widespread acclaim for the performance and song at Eurovision. The media also took note of the kiss exchanged among David, Raggi, and Torchio on the broadcast during the winners' reprise performance at the end of the show, but as explained by David, it was a "spontaneous" gesture to challenge stereotypes and <b>in support of the LGBT community</b>.

            <h2>Dana International: Diva (1998)</h2>
            <p>Sharon Cohen, professionally known as Dana International, is an Israeli pop singer. Sharon's stage name Dana International comes from the title track of her album, and was originally spelled with two n's. At 18 years of age, Cohen (still legally male at the time) earned a living as a drag queen, parodying many famous female singers. Dana was chosen to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 1998 in Birmingham with the song "Diva", and her childhood dream of performing in the song contest finally came true.</p>

            <p>She was tall, svelte and glamorous in a floor-length glitter gown, with luscious brown curls and the kind of dramatic arm movements that would put an ice dancer to shame. Plus, she had an unmistakable pronunciation of the word Cleopatra. Dana International cut a dazzling figure in May 1998 when she won Eurovision for Israel. Her song, Diva, had a lot to do with it: an earworm with a thick club beat and a karaoke-ready chorus that you could make up as you went along if you didn't quite catch all the Hebrew. Dana was also Eurovision's first ever trans winner. Twenty years ago, there was no Ru Paul or Trixie Mattel; the Oscar-winning Hilary Swank movie Boys Don't Cry was a year away. The likes of TV series Transparent, or actors such as Laverne Cox, were off in the distance. The trans community wasn't invisible, but it wasn't the staple of the pop culture conversation that it has become; Dana's performance at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena felt like a watershed moment, a major celebration of a trans artist on an international stage.</p>
            
            <p>It wasn't without its trials, and Dana's representation of her country created a furore among Israel's Orthodox Jewish community. After her win, she addressed her detractors. ‚ÄúMy victory proves God is on my side,‚Äù read her statement. ‚ÄúI want to send my critics a message of forgiveness: try to accept me. I am what I am.‚Äù Today, she claims she enjoyed the backlash. ‚ÄúI don't care what they say about me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI believe in God, in freedom, that everyone has a right to live how they choose.‚Äù</p>

            <h2>Conchita Wurst: Rise Like A Phoenix (2014)</h2>
            <p>Conchita Wurst is an Austrian singer and drag queen. Born in Gmunden, Thomas Neuwirth moved to Graz to do his matura exam with a focus on fashion, before embarking on a singing career through the 2007 casting show Starmania. He subsequently became a founding member of the short-lived boy band Jetzt Anders!. In 2011, Neuwirth began appearing as Conchita‚Äîa female character noted for her beard‚Äîand came second in the Austrian pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012.</p>
            <p>The Austrian entry Conchita Wurst began her performance of her diva anthem Rise Like a Phoenix. As she continued, the lights slowly revealed more of her sparkling, form-hugging dress, before spreading to illuminate her hirsute jaw. Hers was a meticulous drag act, with a twist ‚Äî Conchita Wurst sports a full beard. Eurovision, often associated with camp and queer culture, has long been a forum for these kinds of resistant performances. Camp, though, has rarely been performed with such earnestness. And even rarer still, she won.</p>
            <p>Conchita Wurst's victory at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2014 had a significant impact both within the contest and in the broader social and cultural context. Here are some of the key impacts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Promoting LGBTQ+ Visibility: Conchita Wurst, the stage persona of Austrian singer Thomas Neuwirth, identifies as a drag queen and a gay man. The victory of Conchita Wurst helped to promote LGBTQ+ visibility on a global stage, challenging stereotypes and prejudices. It sparked conversations about gender identity, acceptance, and tolerance, particularly in parts of Eastern Europe where LGBTQ+ rights were less advanced.</li>
                <li>Symbol of Diversity and Inclusion: Conchita Wurst's win was seen as a victory for diversity and inclusion. The song "Rise Like a Phoenix" represented resilience and empowerment. It resonated with many people who felt marginalized or struggled with their identity. The image of Conchita Wurst, with a full beard and feminine attire, challenged traditional notions of gender and beauty, emphasizing that everyone should be accepted for who they are.</li>
                <li>Political and Social Impact: Conchita Wurst's victory sparked discussions about LGBTQ+ rights and acceptance, particularly in countries with more conservative views. It led to debates on equality, discrimination, and human rights. The contest became a platform for addressing these issues and pushing for progress.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Overall, Conchita Wurst's Eurovision victory had a profound impact on promoting LGBTQ+ visibility, fostering discussions on acceptance, and inspiring individuals to embrace diversity and authenticity. It remains an important moment in the history of the Eurovision Song Contest and the broader cultural landscape.</p>

            <h2>Lys Assia: Refrain (1956)</h2>
            <p>Lys Assia (born Rosa Mina Sch√§rer) was a Swiss singer who won the first Eurovision Song Contest in 1956. Assia was born in Rupperswil, Aargau, and began her stage career as a dancer, but changed to singing in 1940 after successfully standing in for a female singer.</p>
            <p>Being the first ever Eurovision winner, Lys Assia may have been entitled to the title of First Lady of the contest, yet she never took it for granted. In fact, she acted as proud ambassador for the contest, the success of which no one could imagine back in the days she took part and won. Especially in the last fifteen years Lys Assia proudly carried out the duties of her role as ambassador ‚Äî a role with unspoken and unwritten duties, most of which she defined herself.</p>
            <p>Lys Assia remained a loyal supporter of the Eurovision Song Contest, being a guest of honour in many occasions, like in Gothenburg in 1985 when Eurovision was celebrating its 30th edition. In 2003, she addressed millions of viewers via a satellite link from Cyprus, wishing the contestants the best of luck ahead of the Grand Final in Riga. Being asked by presenter Marie N., who also won the contest the year before, how she looked back at the 1956 contest, she spoke the legendary words: "It was fun ‚Äî I won!" In 2005, she performed during Congratulations, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest and in 2008 she started the voting in Belgrade.</p>

            <h2>Hatari: Hatri√∞ mun sigra (2019)</h2>
            <p>Hatari is an Icelandic techno, industrial and punk rock band and performance art group from Reykjav√≠k. Their public image incorporates elements of anti-capitalism and BDSM attire. On stage, the group, whose name means ‚ÄúHater‚Äù, presents a fascist-inspired dystopia of blood-splattered whippings. In person, they are softly spoken and occasionally cheerfully optimistic.</p>
            <p>‚ÄúHate will prevail... and Europe's heart impale. Burn off its web of lies. Now from the conflagration... rise in unity.‚Äù ‚Äî what a song for Eurovision, isn't it? The world's longest-running televised song competition boasts a proud history of pop ballads light on meaning and heavy on fun and glitz, making it a wonder that a black leather, highly sexualized group who revel in pain have made it to Eurovision with a song entitled Hate Will Prevail. The pair of cousins, both 25, dreamed up the performance art group during a stroll in the nighttime sun in Reykjav√≠k several years ago, contemplating the rise of populism in Europe. Hate Will Prevail takes it forward, imagining a dark future. The militaristic, authoritarian style of BDSM ‚Äî bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism ‚Äî seemed apt and they have been welcomed, they say, with open arms by the Icelandic fetish community.</p>
            <p>Hatari have emerged as the most controversial act this year, putting politics front of stage in a contest that has been at pains stay apolitical, to the point of adding censorship of lyrics and speeches into its rules. Eurovision, created in 1956 in the aftermath of the second world war, has always been deeply, if not overtly, political. Countries with close linguistic, ethnic or diplomatic ties often vote for each other. Israel has sought to use Eurovision for political gain, originally planning to host it in Jerusalem in a campaign for international recognition of the holy city as its capital. The organisers chose Tel Aviv instead. They have the additional bonus of the fact that everyone loves an outsider ‚Äî especially at Eurovision.</p>
            <p>Hatari have managed to galvanise an army of weirdos, hipsters, homosexuals, grannies and, somewhat inexplicably, their biggest fanbase: Icelandic children. Hatari really put itself in the crossfire in the name of love. It sacrificed itself, just to show Israel and BDS that they can agree on something. They truly brought people together. And they would have deserved to win the award for that.</p>

            <h2>The ‚Äúboring French song‚Äù phenomenon</h2>
            <p>When you hear ‚ÄúFrance‚Äù and ‚ÄúEurovision‚Äù side by side, what distinctive features come to your mind? How would you describe a typical French entry for Eurovision? Most likely roughly like this: an incredibly good-looking woman (less frequently ‚Äî man) in a stunning gown, expressing A LOT of strong emotions, often in the form of a ballad while sounding very ‚Äúfrench‚Äù if you know what I mean. All these epithets formed a kind of stereotype of a typical French performance at the Eurovision Song Contest, as the Youtube comments section confirms. A huge number of people write about how the French performances look and sound the same every year. And they are not entirely wrong here. Obviously, beauty is in eye of the beholder, but the ‚Äúfrench pattern‚Äù is definitely a thing.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, the last song in French that won Eurovision was performed by Celine Dion of Switzerland in 1988. Even though France had won first place five times before 1988, the song by Celine Dion was the last winning song in French in the last 35 years. One can assume that, in a sense, this performance defined this stereotype of most French-speaking performances. One can assume that, in a sense, this performance defined this stereotype of most French-speaking performances. This format, as we can see, has not been the most successful in the last 35 years.</p>
            <p>To illustrate that, let's have a look at Lisa Angell's "N'oubliez Pas". Safe to say that this performance checks nearly all the contingent criteria of a typical ‚Äúboring French song‚Äú: a woman in an elegant black dress singing in a tearful voice about the need to remember World War I and, more broadly, wars in general. This is certainly a very strong message, but probably not the best format for a contest like this. Thus, the singer took 25th place out of 27.</p>
