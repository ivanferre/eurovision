            <p>
                The Eurovision Song Contest is an <b>international song competition</b> organized annually by the European Broadcasting Union. Each participating country submits an original song to be performed live and transmitted to national broadcasters via the Eurovision and Euroradio networks, with competing countries then casting votes for the other countries' songs to determine a winner.</p>
            <p>
                Traditionally held in the country which won the preceding year's event, the contest provides an opportunity to <b>promote the host country and city</b> as a tourist destination. Thousands of spectators attend each year, along with journalists who cover all aspects of the contest, including rehearsals in venues, press conferences with the competing acts, in addition to other related events and performances in the host city.

            <h2>ABBA: Waterloo (1974)</h2>

            <p>ABBA are a Swedish super-group formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. The group's name is an acronym of the first letters of their first names arranged as a palindrome. They are <b>one of the most popular and successful musical groups of all time</b>, and are one of the best-selling music acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982, and in 2022.
            </p>
            <p>In 1974, ABBA were Sweden's first winner of the Eurovision Song Contest with the song "Waterloo", which was <b>specifically</b> to be entered into the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. The original title of the song was "Honey Pie". The song's lyrics are metaphorical and are about a woman who "surrenders" to a man and promises to love him, likening it to Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.
            </p>
            <p>The song differed from the standard "dramatic ballad" tradition of the Eurovision Song Contest by its <b>and rhythm</b>, as well as by its performance. ABBA gave the audience something that had rarely been seen before in Eurovision: <b>flashy costumes</b> (including silver platform boots), plus a catchy uptempo song and even simple choreography. In 2005, “Waterloo” was chosen as the <b>best song in the competition's history</b> as part of the 50th anniversary celebration of the contest.</p>

            <video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAh9NRGNhUU"></video>
            <p>Lordi is a Finnish rock band, formed in 1992 by the band's lead singer, songwriter, and costume maker, Mr. Lordi (Tomi Petteri Putaansuu). Influenced by hard rock and heavy metal music, Lordi are known for wearing <b>monster masks</b> and using horror elements with pyrotechnics during concerts and music videos.</p>
            <p>The song was the surprise winner of the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest. Lordi is a Finnish monster rock band, and their entry attracted controversy and was regarded as something of a joke. <b>Finland had never won Eurovision</b> since its inception in 1956, and because of the country's appalling record it was decided that it had nothing to lose. But Lordi had the last laugh, and romped home with a record 292 points.</p>

            </p>
            <p>His win was celebrated throughout Europe for <b>crushing stereotypes</b> about the contest, such as needing an over-the-top performance or the influence of neighbor voting.
